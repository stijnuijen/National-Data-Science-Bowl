Traditional methods for measuring and monitoring plankton populations are time consuming and cannot scale to the granularity or scope necessary for large-scale studies. Improved approaches are needed. One such approach is through the use of an underwater imagery sensor. This towed, underwater camera system captures microscopic, high-resolution images over large study areas. The images can then be analyzed to assess species populations and distributions.

Manual analysis of the imagery is infeasible – it would take a year or more to manually analyze the imagery volume captured in a single day. Automated image classification using machine learning tools is an alternative to the manual approach. Analytics will allow analysis at speeds and scales previously thought impossible. The automated system will have broad applications for assessment of ocean and ecosystem health.

The National Data Science Bowl challenges you to build an algorithm to automate the image identification process. Scientists at the Hatfield Marine Science Center and beyond will use the algorithms you create to study marine food webs, fisheries, ocean conservation, and more. This is your chance to contribute to the health of the world’s oceans, one plankton at a time.
